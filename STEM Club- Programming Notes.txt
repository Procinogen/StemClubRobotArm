STEM Club project programming notes
	-Either using Raspberry Pi or Arduino
		-I might be using an Arduino, it can take analog inputs and already has a breadboard
		-If I were to use a Raspberry Pi I would need a breadboard... what are the advantages to using a raspberry pi?
		-There is on the other hand, one for servo motors, the "Arduino Servo Library", sounds the most useful as it has functions designed around the servos

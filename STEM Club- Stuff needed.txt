List:
~Basics~
	-Raspberry Pi Model B(done)
		-Previous 2 were fried... I need to get another one
	-Breadboard (Done)
		-Should upgrade to circuit board post-prototyping phase
	-Jumper Wires (Done)
	-Some kind of power source (done)

~Sensory and Conversion~
	-Some kind of ADC chip
		-MPC3008 looks good enough, though the page said it's best for simple inputs
	-Two Gyroscopes
		-The MPU6050 looks good enough, it doubles as an accelerometer and is fairly cheap.
	-5 Flex Sensors
		-https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8606 three of these
		-https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10264 two of these (or just five of these)

~Motors and Motor Control~
	-Servo Motors, Obviously
		-9 will be needed
			-5 for the fingers, 2 for the wrist (one for up and down motion, the other for rotational motion), 1 for bicep and 1 to control the side to side movement of the forearm
	-A servo driver to prevent jittering
		-https://www.adafruit.com/product/815 this one looks promising
		
~Construction~
	-Various 3D printed parts
		-Manasseh will be in charge of that
	-Some kind of internal bone structure
		-Ball joints will act as well.. the joints
